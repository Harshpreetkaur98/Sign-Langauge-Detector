ipykernel - Allows to associate our virtual environment with our jupyter notebook.
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tfodj (telling the name of the virtual name to the jupyter) = installing the virtual environment into jupyter 

For labeling images, Library called labelImg has been used. (https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg)

uuid = Universally unique identifiers used for generating unique ids for databases, creating session tokens
for authentication, etc. , allowing to name images uniquely to stop any collisions

os - operating systems

Opencv = open computer vision, for accessing webcam and collecting images

When running evaluation = you get precision and MAP
MAP:- Mean average precision (What propotion of the calculation was correct)
MAP = No. of true positive detections/False positives
TP:- Detects correct
FP:- When detects something even though there is nothing there
TN:- When not detected anything and there is nothing
FN:- Does not detects when there is something 

Precision = TP/ (TP + FP)
Recall: TP/(TP + FN)

Loss:- A method to evaluate how well the model is performing against the data provided.

Tensorflow model zoo:- https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md
Using diff models is going to result in diff levels of accuracy and speed.
Model used:- SSD Mobile V2 FPNLite 320x320 (320 is basically the model compressing the images down in the preprocessing step and in post processing will convert it back to original)
